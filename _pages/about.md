Dian Shen is is currently an associate professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University. He is also a "Zhi Shan" Exellent Young Scholar at Southeast University. Dr. Shen received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the School of Software Engineering, Southeast University in 2010 and 2012 respectively. In 2018, he obtained his PhD degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, under the supervision of [Prof. Luo Junzhou](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0102/c23024a257045/page.htm).

In 2013, he participated in the European Union Framework Programme-7 "Marie Curie" Talent Plan and worked as a visiting researcher at the Coventry University in the UK. In 2021, supported by the "Jiangsu Province Excellent Young Teachers Overseas Research Program," he worked as a visiting researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. John C.S. Lui](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cslui/).
